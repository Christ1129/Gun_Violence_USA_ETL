# Gun_Violence_USA_ETL

The basis for our Extrating, Transforming, and Loading data is centered around gun violence information.  The data included findings on accidental shootings, accidental deaths, and mass shootings over a multi year span.  Data was extrated and transformed using Pandas and SQLAlchemy, while the loading process was completed using Postgres and pg Admin 4.
