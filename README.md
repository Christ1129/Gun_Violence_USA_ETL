# Gun_Violence_USA_ETL

By Elton Cummings, III , Christian Tourteau

# Summary:

the phenomenon of gun violence is very present in the minds of all who live in the United States currently. This has targeted our curiosity to research this topic.. This database could be useful in the process of researching guns in the USA

# Extraction

This project utilized two sources of data to analyze information about Gun Violence in USA. We used 2 datasets from  Kaggle and archives.org. The sources for our dataset are as follows: 

•	Accidental deaths

•	Accidental injuries

•	Mass shooting

# Transformation

During the transformation process, we performed the following:

•	we analyzed our files by limiting ourselves to useful information. 

•	We filtered and removed unnecessary columns to limit our dataset to columns relevant to our work ( operator’s column and the address column).

•	We rename the columns

# Load

our last step was to transfer our final output to a database. we hosted this data in a relational database (using Postgres) which will support the column and row structure of our dataframes.

# Conclusion

The databases that were created from the extraction, transformation and loading process during this project may be useful for researchers in the field of gun violence in the USA. However, there are limitations to this project, due to the available data (only csv). In future research, we could join data on police by state and see if there is a correlation between the number of police officers and the crime rate by state.
